# SQL-Code
My solved SQL exercises

In this repository, I am sharing SQL queries that I have written.
Those queries are my solutions to this "DATAWITHDANNY.COM" practices shared here: https://8weeksqlchallenge.com

If you're enthusiastic with SQL as I am, or if you just want to work on your SQL coding abilities, I challenge you to go and solve these 8 case studies!
You are more than welcome to get any solution ideas from my shared queries here.

** Note - I used MS SQL Server (SSMS) database to run the queries. Therefore the syntax used is of T-SQL.
